        <h2>My Reflections</h2>
        <p>In this lesson, I have learned to set up Github. I have not used Git Hub before, but I know that it will a god platform to use during this course.
             After setting up Git Hub and read articles on it to familiarize myself with the platform. I also learned how to Configure the 
             settings in Git Bash, such as my username and email.
              The three things that were new to me was adding comments into html, adding commits, and cloning a URL. 
              Adding commits will help with saving a message to a certain file, adding comments on html and CSS will
               help me to keep a note on what I want to add or where I left off, and cloning a URL is great to use to get your URL.</p>

        <h2>My Next Steps</h2>
        <p>The property or concept I would like to go more in depth in is working on the flexible element.
             This property specifies the alignment in the block direction for the selected item inside a flexbox
              or grid container. It aligns different items. I feel like that is not my strongest area. But, with 
              more practice, I will be better at it. The steps I would take is‚Äù build a webpage, add <p> elements,
                 and build a table with columns and rows and work off of that to code in a grid container, and then 
                 add styles to it.</p>
